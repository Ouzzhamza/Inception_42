Here is a high-level overview of how nginx works with the FastCGI protocol:

    A client sends a request to nginx.
    Nginx receives the request and determines that it should be forwarded to a FastCGI application.
    Nginx establishes a connection with the FastCGI application using the FastCGI protocol.
    Nginx forwards the request to the FastCGI application.
    The FastCGI application processes the request and generates a response.
    The FastCGI application sends the response back to nginx.
    Nginx receives the response and sends it back to the client.

In this way, nginx acts as a "gateway" between clients and the FastCGI application, allowing the application to be used to serve web content without the client being aware of its existence. This can be useful for improving the performance and scalability of web applications.

In this diagram, the client sends an HTTP request to nginx, which acts as a reverse proxy for the FastCGI application. Nginx forwards the request to the FastCGI application using the FastCGI protocol, and the application processes the request and generates a response. The response is then sent back to nginx, which forwards it to the client. In this way, nginx acts as a gateway between the client and the FastCGI application, allowing the application to be used to serve web content without the client being aware of its existence


Question : how does Nginx receives the request and determines that it should be forwarded to a FastCGI application.

Answear :When using nginx with the FastCGI protocol, nginx is typically configured to forward requests for certain URLs or file types to a FastCGI application. This is done using the fastcgi_pass directive in the nginx configuration file.

For example, if you wanted to configure nginx to forward all requests for PHP files to a FastCGI application running on the local host on port 9000, you could use the following configuration:

location ~ \.php$ {
  fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
}

This configuration tells nginx to forward any requests that match the regular expression \.php$ (i.e., requests for URLs ending in ".php") to the FastCGI application running on the local host on port 9000.

When nginx receives a request, it checks the configuration file to determine if the request should be forwarded to a FastCGI application. If the request matches the criteria specified in the fastcgi_pass directive, nginx establishes a connection with the FastCGI application using the FastCGI protocol and forwards the request to the application. The application then processes the request and returns a response, which nginx forwards back to the client.

If the request does not match the criteria specified in the fastcgi_pass directive, nginx will handle the request itself, either by serving the requested content from its local file system or by returning an error if the requested content is not found.
